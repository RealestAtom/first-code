# First-Code

## Project Overview  
This repository contains a collection of front-end web development projects built using HTML and CSS. These projects demonstrate responsive design, layout structuring, and user-interface styling.

## Technologies Used  
- HTML  
- CSS  
- (Optionally: JavaScript, if any interactive parts exist)  
- Responsive design techniques

## Project Structure  
- `index.html` — Main landing page  
- `about.html` — About page  
- `service.html` — Services page  
- `mmmmm.html` / `PART_FOUR.html` — Additional pages / project variants  
- `css/` — Folder containing CSS files for styling  
- `img/` — Folder containing images used in the projects

## How to Run Locally  
1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash  
   git clone https://github.com/RealestAtom/first-code.git  
   ```  
2. Navigate into the project directory:  
   ```bash  
   cd first-code  
   ```  
3. Open `index.html` in your web browser to view the main page.

## What I Learned  
- Structuring a multi-page website layout  
- Using CSS for styling and responsive design  
- Organizing files and assets (CSS folder, image folder)  
- Translating design concepts into working front-end code  

## Next Steps & Improvements  
- Enhance responsiveness across more device sizes  
- Add interactive JavaScript features (e.g., navigation menu toggle, dynamic content)  
- Refine accessibility and semantic HTML structure  
- Consider deploying to a live environment (e.g., GitHub Pages) for public showcase
